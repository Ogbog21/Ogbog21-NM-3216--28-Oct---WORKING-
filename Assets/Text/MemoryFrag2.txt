THE SECOND FRAGMENT
The First Wolf ran through the great lands and lakes, 
And climbed through every valley, unto every mountaintop. 
But at the peak of the world, The First cried a great cry from her loneliness. 
At the First Cry, her two front teeth fell: 
These were the first light and shadow within the Great Forest.
